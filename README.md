# Smart Meeting Room

*The Python script scans the meeting room and update the status on Salesforce cloud. Then mobile application can be used to check the status of the meeting room (Occupied or Vacant)*

## Project Structure

* ***human_detector.py*** - This class will detect the presence of person in room.
* ***salesforce_connection.py*** - This class helps python to connect with your salesforce cloud.
* ***MeetingRoomPersonDetector.py*** - This is the main class which monitors the presence and post the data to cloud.

### Deep Neural Netwrok
* SSD Caffe model (Single shot multibox detector). It is by far the best model to detect multiple objects in realtime.
* Prototext Model

### Hardware
* Raspberry Pi 3 Model b+
* Pi Camera

> You can use saleforce iot cloud application for free. I have setup custom object, context, orchestrtion in salesforce.

## Coding Background

```python
    WINDOW_DETECTION = 5    # Number of loops a camera will check to take decision on the occupancy
    PRESENCE_THRESHOLD = 3  # Minimum Presence should be this to mark room as occupied else vacant
    VACANCY_THRESHOLD = 1   # Room will be marked as vacant after this threshold meets
```
